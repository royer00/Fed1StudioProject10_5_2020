I want your answer and the money by noon tomorrow. And one more thing. Don't you contact me again, ever. From now on, you deal with Turnbull. What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? "Oh, what do I do? What do I do?" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous
                        Fredo, you're my older brother, and I love you. But don't ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever. I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart! This one time, this one time I'll let you ask me about my affairs. I don't trust a doctor who can hardly speak English. I see you took the name of the town. What was your father's name?

You broke my heart! This one time, this one time I'll let you ask me about my affairs. I don't trust a doctor who can hardly speak English. I see you took the name of the town. What was your father's name?
                        Sonny, please don't do anything. Please don't do anything. Don't you know that I would use all of my power to prevent something like that from happening? I want your answer and the money by noon tomorrow. And one more thing. Don't you contact me again, ever. From now on, you deal with Turnbull. What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? "Oh, what do I do? What do I do?" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous!
                        Fredo, you're my older brother, and I love you. But don't ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever. I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart! This one time, this one time I'll let you ask me about my affairs. I don't trust a doctor who can hardly speak English. I see you took the name of the town. What was your father's name?
